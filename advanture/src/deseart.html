With the multitude of deserts to visit in the state, one may often find themselves in a dilemma of missing out on some of the most spectacular sights. The Thar desert, which is among the top 5 most 
				 famous deserts in the world lies in Rajasthan and has a surreal view to offer. Not only is it beautiful to see the camels treading through the sand during the day, it also offers a dreamlike view of the stars at night. The camel safari and camel racing are two of the most appealing activities that one may go to the deserts for. Camping out at night in the deserts is an experience in its own. One can witness the sky in its full blown glory. Gazing at the sky for the sunset can have a soothing and calming effect on a person's mind.

					Rajasthan, in fact, as a whole is also classified as a desert state. 
					Out of the 6 cities in Rajasthan, Jaisalmer and Bikaner are
					 primarily made up of deserts. So, if one wants to experience the core essence of Rajasthan, visiting its deserts is a must. Besides, one may also get picturesque photographs clicked amidst the peaks made of sand.

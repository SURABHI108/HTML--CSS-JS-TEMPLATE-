				</h1>
                <p class="story-paragraph">
                 In order to reach Sheesh Mahal, you have to go through the entry point of 
				 Amber Fort that is called Ganesh Pol. After your entry to Ganesh Pol you will reach into a square called Jaleb Chowk. Right from Jaleb Chowk there is a vast pathway leading toward a colossal community hall called as Diwaan-e-aam. 

				From Diwaan-e-aam you have to move forward again toward the 3rd floor of the fort. 
				On the Left hand side of the fort Jai Mandir is positioned and 
				the Sheesh Mahal is located inside the Jai Mandir.

                  <center>Legends From Shrinathji Temple History</center>
				</h1>
                <p class="story-paragraph">
                 There are various legends and myths associated with the Nathdwara Temple in Rajasthan as well as the idol of its presiding deity.

				One of the interesting legends tells the story of how the stone idol of Shrinathji came to be installed at the Nathdwara Temple near Udaipur. The idol was being transported southwards from Vrindavan to Agra and onwards in a chariot or bullock cart, to ensure its safety from the religious persecution unleashed by Aurangzeb.
				 Near a village named Sihad or Sinhad, the wheels the vehicle bearing the idol sank in the ground and refused to budge. This was taken as a signal that the Lord wanted to reside in this place. This is how the Shreenathji Temple Nathdwara came to be.

				Another legend is drawn from the annals of the Pushtimarg, the sect of Vaishnavism founded by Vallabhacharya. According to it, Shrinathji (Krishna) was in the habit of visiting the region of Mewar to play Chaupar, an ancient Indian game of dice, with a princess named Ajab Kumari.

				As Shrinathji had to leave to return to his home in Vrindavan, the princess used to get upset and would urge him to stay back. Shrinathj consoled her by saying that at an appropriate time, he would come and stay there permanently. The movement of the idol of Shrinathji and its installation in Nathdwara is believed to be the redemption of this promise that the Lord gave to the princess.				</p>
